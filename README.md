AUTHOR : Aadarsh Gupta

# Introduction

This is one of the most famous machine learning projects with Iris Flowers being the simplest machine learning datasets in classification literature. The iris dataset is small which easily fits into the memory and does not require any special transformations or scaling, to begin with. The software aims to classify the flowers into among the three species â€“ virginica, setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals. The software is trained on 7 different Machine Learning methods on dataset of 150 annotated images, with 112 of them taken as training data and rest 38 of data points as validation data. The collection of models derived gives 100% classification results for the validation datasets for each of the algorithms.

# Packages Used
The following packages have been used while training of the model and visualization puposes :
- numpy : for linear algebra operations
- pandas : for data processing operations I/O in CSV file
- scikit-learn : to implement machine learning methods
- matplotlib : for data visualization and graphical plotting
- seaborn : for data visualization for statistical graphics plotting
- pickle : for serializing and de-serializing python object structures (saving the loaded models)
